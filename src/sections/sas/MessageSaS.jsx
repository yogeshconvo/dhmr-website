                Welcome to the School of Allied Sciences (SAS) at Datta Meghe
                Institute of Higher Education and Research (Deemed-to-be
                University)! At SAS, we are committed to providing a dynamic and
                holistic educational experience that blends management,
                technology, and healthcare. As a forward-thinking institution,
                we recognize the growing intersection between healthcare and
                other industries, and our programs are carefully designed to
                equip students with the skills needed to thrive in this evolving
                landscape.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4">
                Our aim is to nurture professionals who are not only technically
                proficient and innovative but also socially responsible and
                ready to make a meaningful impact on the healthcare sector and
                beyond. With an emphasis on hands-on learning, collaboration,
                and real-world problem solving, we prepare our students to lead
                with integrity and vision, whether they are pursuing careers in
                health IT, hospital management, or other related fields.
