          From primary care to advanced tertiary services, DMIHERâ€™s hospital
          network across Wana and Wardha campuses brings together scale,
          specialization, and compassion. With over 2,500 beds, NABH- and
          NABL-accredited facilities, and a reach of over 50 lakh lives, these
          hospitals deliver world-class diagnostics, surgeries, critical care,
          maternal-child services, oncology, and super-speciality treatments.
          Whether in the heart of rural Vidarbha or the evolving healthcare hub
          of Nagpur, every campus is united by one mission: to make quality
          healthcare accessible, affordable, and exceptional.
