Radhikabai Meghe Memorial College of Nursing, Datta Meghe Institute of Higher Education & Research (Deemed to be University). It has always been proved as the best Institute for education and also for intellectual, physical and moral development of students. We express our deep sense of gratitude to all the teaching staffs, the non-teaching staffs and also the management for helping and guiding our child in best possible way throughout the sessions. The best thing we found about this Institute was that our child was able to stay connected even after graduation which helped her to grow even more was through the alumni meets. The alumni has been found the best way of staying in touch to explore more and to stay connected with her teachers and batchmates. This institute has given much more than education to our daughter and it’s a great privilege for us to be a part of this institute.",
